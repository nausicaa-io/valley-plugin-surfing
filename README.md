# Surfing

Embedded browser: open websites as workspace tabs with isolated profiles, history and ad-blocking — and let the assistant drive pages (navigate, click, fill forms, screenshot).

Open `.url` Internet shortcuts to view their saved HTTP(S) website. Edit the address and choose **Save URL** (or press Enter) to update the shortcut while preserving its other fields and line endings. **Reload file** discards the address draft and reads the latest file. Conflicting external edits are never overwritten.

Open `.mhtml` and `.mht` archives as read-only offline pages with captured styles, images, and fonts. Scripts, forms, live links, frames, and network requests are disabled; links within the saved page remain usable. Resources missing from the archive remain unavailable.

Open `.har` files in a read-only HTTP request inspector. Search requests and select a row to inspect headers, cookies, query parameters, request payloads, captured text/JSON responses, and timings. Binary and uncaptured response bodies are identified without execution. Requests are never replayed.

The assistant tool `browser_fetch_url` fetches a URL and returns its readable content as Markdown. HTML is reduced to the main article with absolute links; JSON is pretty-printed and plain text passes through. Fetches run in the plugin backend without cookies. HTTP is upgraded to HTTPS; private and local hosts are blocked. Responses are limited to 4 MiB, and at most 5 redirects are followed. Long results are paged with `maxChars` and `startIndex`, and a fetched page is reused for 10 minutes. With `render: true`, the page loads in one visible Surfing tab and is read after its scripts run. Every fetch appears live in the sidebar's **Assistant** list, which is kept only for the current session; select a row to open the page. The `surfing:fetch` command (`surfing fetch <url> [--max-chars N] [--start-index N]` in the CLI) is free under every guard preset. The visible-tab `surfing:fetch-rendered` command asks for confirmation under Recommended and is denied under Read-only.

Archive viewers reload after external file changes and provide **Reload file** for retrying failed or changed reads. Reads use temporary read-only vault storage grants and 512 KiB chunks. Files and expanded preview resources are limited to 64 MiB; MHTML parsing also limits nesting to 20 levels and MIME parts to 10,000. HAR lists show 100 requests per page. No archive content is written or uploaded.

This repository owns the plugin’s interface, behavior, dependencies, schemas, tests, translations, and compiled releases. It uses Valley manifest API 5 and the injected SDK 6.

Valley ships this core plugin as a verified release artifact in its application resources. Core and external installations run with the same sandbox, permissions, and SDK/IPC contract. The core package and its locale files are never installed into `.valley`; ordinary vault documents and saved plugin data retain their existing locations.

## Package

- `manifest.json`: readable English identity, version, and paired `author` / `authorUrl` arrays.
- `config.json`: runtime entry points, permissions, contributions, and storage declarations.
- `src/`: plugin interface and background engine.
- `locales/`: English, German, Spanish, French, and Simplified Chinese catalogs.
- `tests/`: package-owned checks using the portable SDK testkit.
- `runtime/`: compiled installation artifact, including the package’s locale catalogs.
- `vendor/`: pinned SDK, testkit, and build-tool archives for independent development.

The package’s `manifest.name` and `manifest.description` catalog entries translate its identity, including while disabled. Missing translations fall back to this package’s English catalog. A plugin never falls back to Valley’s catalog or another plugin’s catalog.

## Development and releases

Use Node 24.19.0 and npm 11.17.0. From this repository, run:

```sh
npm ci
npm run check
```

The check validates types and package boundaries, runs the package tests, and rebuilds `runtime/`. It requires no Valley source checkout. Keep the rebuilt runtime, locale files, dependency lock, and vendored tools with each release. Increment the package and manifest versions together.

Valley release maintainers explicitly import the compiled artifact into the application’s `plugins.lock.json`; building Valley does not build or read this repository. All privileged work uses declared SDK capabilities, authenticated IPC, and explicit grants. Disabling or unloading the plugin releases its subscriptions and resources.
